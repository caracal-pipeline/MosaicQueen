# MosaicSteward
A package with mosaicking commands from montage, that also does primary-beam correction. Originally written to be used by stimela (https://github.com/SpheMakh/Stimela) for automated radio-data reduction, but it also works independently. Packaged on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/MosaicSteward/) and so it is installable via
```
pip install MosaicSteward
```

Work in progress: convolution of input images to a common synthesised beam before mosaicking, and employing parallel processing to speed this up...
