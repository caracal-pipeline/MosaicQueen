|Pypi Version|

A package with mosaicking commands from montage, that also does primary-beam correction for both 2D and 3D images. Originally written to be used by stimela (https://github.com/SpheMakh/Stimela) and CARACal (coming soon!) for automated radio-data reduction, but it also works independently. Packaged on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/MosaicSteward/) and so it is installable via
.. code-block::
pip install MosaicSteward

Work in progress: convolution of input images to a common synthesised beam before mosaicking, and employing parallel processing to speed this up...
