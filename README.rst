|Pypi Version|

A package with mosaicking commands from montage, that also does primary-beam correction for both 2D and 3D images. Originally written to be used by stimela (https://github.com/SpheMakh/Stimela) and, ultimately, CARACal (https://github.com/caracal-pipeline/caracal) for automated radio-data reduction, but it also works independently. Packaged on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/mosaic-queen) and so it is installable via ``pip install mosaicQueen``.


Work in progress: convolution of input images to a common synthesised beam before mosaicking, and employing parallel processing to speed this up...
